# Yardstick

**On-device LLM benchmark for Apple Silicon — iPhone · iPad · Mac.**

A neutral, reproducible benchmark for running local LLMs (and, in time, ASR / TTS) on Apple Silicon. Compares **MLX Swift, llama.cpp, CoreML (swift-transformers), LiteRT-LM, ExecuTorch, ANEMLL** — and Apple's own Foundation Models — under real device constraints, not just `tok/s` on a server.

> Repo: `apple-silicon-llm-bench` · CLI/brand: `yardstick`. Started life as `ios-llm-benchmark` — iPhone is still the headline target, now measured alongside iPad and Mac.

---

## 📱 TL;DR — iPhone 17 Pro (A19 Pro)

The headline is the phone: real LLM inference, on-device, no server. iPhone 17 Pro, 4-bit, short-chat (128 tokens), median of 3 cold runs.

![iPhone 17 Pro — decode tok/s + peak memory, MLX-Swift vs llama.cpp](docs/charts/iphone_decode_mem.png)

| Logical model | Params | n | **mlx-swift** decode | llama.cpp decode | **mlx-swift** mem | llama.cpp mem |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 3.5 2B | 2 B | 3 | **61.2 tok/s** | 39.1 | **1279 MB** | 1479 |
| Gemma 4 E2B | 2 B | 3 | **47.5 tok/s** | 37.8 | **2900 MB** | 3156 |

- **MLX-Swift wins decode _and_ peak memory on both models** — 1.25×–1.6× faster than llama.cpp and a touch leaner in RAM. Same ranking as on the M4 Max desktop.
- **The on-device tax is real:** roughly 4–5× slower than the M4 Max at the same model + runtime (Qwen 3.5 2B → 61 tok/s on iPhone vs 292 on M4 Max).
- **Fully automated, side-loaded:** runs are driven headlessly from a Mac via `devicectl` — nothing typed on the phone — using the *same* methodology as the desktop rows.
- **Coming next:** CoreML/ANE, Apple Foundation Models, LiteRT-LM, more models and more iPhones / iPads. [One row is a great PR](CONTRIBUTING.md).

> Decode tok/s is the headline number; the full per-run audit (prefill, TTFT, inter-token jitter, memory) lives in [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md).

## 🖥 Desktop reference — Apple M4 Max

The same harness on a laptop-class chip, for scale. No runtime wins everything here — each optimises a different corner of the throughput / memory / energy / streaming box:

![Throughput × Energy tradeoff](docs/charts/tradeoff.png)

- **mlx-swift** wins decode throughput on every cell measured (1.4×–1.8× over llama.cpp after early-2026 kernel updates).
- **Apple Foundation Models** is 2× more energy-efficient per token than the GPU-backed runtimes, 4× more than CoreML/ANE.
- **CoreML / ANE** wins peak memory (chunked MLKV) but is the slowest *and* the worst on J/token.
- **llama.cpp** sits in the middle on speed and energy — no axis it wins, no axis it loses badly.

## 📊 Full numbers — Apple M4 Max, short-chat (128 tokens, decode tok/s, median)

> One device, four runtimes, multiple models. Decode tok/s is the primary headline number; the full table (prefill, TTFT, peak memory, per-run audit trail) lives in [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md). Read the [Headline observations](RESULTS.md#headline-observations-read-this-after-the-tables) section before drawing conclusions — the runtime ranking is **model-size-dependent**.

### Cross-runtime — same logical model, different backends (decode tok/s, median)

| Logical model | Params | n | mlx-swift (Q4) | llama.cpp (Q4_K_M) | coreml-llm | litert-lm (.litertlm) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 0.5 B | 3 | **531.1** | 297.1 | 181.2 (FP16) | n/a |
| Qwen 3.5 0.8B | 0.8 B | 3 | **421.1** | 201.1 | 58.2 (INT8) | n/a |
| Qwen 3.5 2B   | 2 B   | 3 | **291.9** | 149.7 | 35.0 (INT8) | n/a |
| Gemma 4 E2B   | 2 B   | 3 | **185.4** | 119.2 | 32.5 (INT4 palettized) | _pending_ |
| Gemma 4 E4B   | 4 B   | 3 | **113.5** | 80.5 | _not run_ | _pending_ |

> `litert-lm` column: **_pending_** = adapter wired against `google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM` v0.12.0, M4 Max run not yet captured (see [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) / `Yardstick_USER_RUNS.md`). **n/a** = LiteRT-LM's catalog is Gemma-only (`.litertlm`), so the Qwen rows have no entry. For reference, Google's E2B model card reports 56.5 tok/s on iPhone 17 Pro GPU — a vendor figure on a different device, not an M4 Max Yardstick measurement.

→ **MLX-Swift now wins decode on every cell** — 1.4×–1.8× over llama.cpp — after upstream `mlx-swift-lm` shipped Qwen + Gemma kernel updates in early 2026 (the Qwen rows roughly tripled vs. the snapshot captured before those landed). The old "llama.cpp Metal always wins small-model decode" rule is no longer true on M4 Max; re-measure before quoting it. CoreML / ANE is the slowest of the three on every cell, in exchange for the dramatic memory savings shown below.

### Cross-runtime — peak memory (MB, median)

The decode-tok/s table above hides the memory side. Same models, looking at peak working-set instead:

| Logical model | Params | mlx-swift | llama.cpp | coreml-llm | litert-lm |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 0.5 B | **390** | 538 | 962 | n/a |
| Qwen 3.5 0.8B | 0.8 B | **600** | 752 | 221 (INT8) | n/a |
| Qwen 3.5 2B   | 2 B   | 1223 | 1443 | **230** (INT8) | n/a |
| Gemma 4 E2B   | 2 B   | 2829 | 3212 | **1036** | _pending_ |
| Gemma 4 E4B   | 4 B   | **4376** | 5150 | — | _pending_ |

→ **"CoreML/ANE wins memory" is true once the chunked MLKV layout kicks in.** At 0.5 B params MLX-Swift is still smaller (413 MB vs CoreML's 959 MB monolithic FP16); from 0.8 B onward, CoreML's chunked MLKV path (`Qwen35MLKVGenerator`: mmap'd embed sidecar + on-demand ANE chunks) holds the process RSS roughly flat — 206 MB at 0.8 B, 215 MB at 2 B — while MLX and llama.cpp scale linearly with parameter count.

### Cross-runtime — energy per token (Gemma 4 E2B, sustained-512, M4 Max)

The number nobody else publishes: how many joules does each backend burn per generated token? Captured via [`scripts/measure_energy.py`](scripts/measure_energy.py) which co-runs `powermetrics` (whole-system, package power = CPU + GPU + ANE) and clips the sample window to the bench's reported active time.

| Runtime | Avg pkg power (W) | Energy / 512-tok run (J) | **J / token** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **apple-fm** (system model) | 7.6  | 67.4  | **0.11** |
| mlx-swift (4-bit MLX) | 24.7 | 123.0 | 0.24 |
| llama.cpp (Q4_K_M, GGUF) | 24.5 | 126.3 | 0.25 |
| coreml-llm (INT4 palettized, ANE) | 12.7 | 244.9 | 0.48 |

→ **Energy ranking inverts the decode-tok/s ranking.** Apple FM is 2× more efficient per token than the GPU-backed runtimes despite producing tokens at ~half the rate. CoreML/ANE has the lowest *instantaneous* power (12.7 W) but is the *worst* J/tok at 4× Apple FM, because the slower decode (32 tok/s) keeps the package powered up much longer. MLX-Swift and llama.cpp draw the most W (GPU) but produce tokens fast enough to break even at ~0.24 J/tok. Whole-system measurement includes the idle baseline so all four numbers slightly inflate per-token energy — useful for ranking, not for absolute attribution. iPhone energy uses the 1 %-battery-step API instead (different methodology, similar table shape).

### Per-runtime model scaling

<sub>**llama.cpp** (Q4_K_M GGUF, M4 Max, short-chat)</sub>

| Model | Params | n | TTFT (ms) | Decode tok/s | Peak Mem (MB) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 0.5 B | 3 | 22  | 297.1 | 538 |
| Qwen 3.5 0.8B | 0.8 B | 3 | 22  | 201.1 | 752 |
| Llama 3.2 1B  | 1.0 B | 3 | 25  | **285.9** | 1022 |
| Qwen 3.5 2B   | 2 B   | 3 | 29  | 149.7 | 1443 |
| Gemma 4 E2B   | 2 B   | 3 | 41  | 119.2 | 3212 |
| Gemma 4 E4B   | 4 B   | 3 | 62  | 80.5  | 5150 |

<sub>**mlx-swift** (Q4 / MLX, M4 Max, short-chat)</sub>

| Model | Params | n | TTFT (ms) | Decode tok/s | Peak Mem (MB) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 0.5 B | 3 | 21  | **531.1** | 390 |
| Qwen 3.5 0.8B | 0.8 B | 3 | 36  | **421.1** | 600 |
| Qwen 3.5 2B   | 2 B   | 3 | 42  | **291.9** | 1223 |
| Gemma 4 E2B   | 2 B   | 3 | 68  | 185.4     | 2829 |
| Gemma 4 E4B   | 4 B   | 3 | 90  | 113.5     | 4376 |

<sub>**coreml-llm** (CoreML / ANE, M4 Max, short-chat)</sub>

| Model | Params | n | TTFT (ms) | Decode tok/s | Peak Mem (MB) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LFM 2.5 350M  | 0.35 B | 1 | 383 | 58.9  | **98**  |
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 0.5 B  | 3 | 171 | 181.2 | 962     |
| Qwen 3.5 0.8B | 0.8 B  | 3 | 405 | 58.2  | **221** |
| Qwen 3.5 2B   | 2 B    | 3 | 665 | 35.0  | **230** |
| Gemma 4 E2B   | 2 B    | 3 | 525 | 32.5  | 1036    |

→ CoreML/ANE trades throughput for memory: 3-8× less peak working set than MLX-Swift / llama.cpp at the same model size, at ~half the decode tok/s. The Qwen 3.5 0.8B / 2B numbers come from the dedicated `Qwen35MLKVGenerator` (ANE chunked decode, KV in `MLState` — public API since CoreML-LLM `v1.9.0`), not the generic `CoreMLLLM.load(from:)` path.

### Apple Foundation Models (system, on-device — reference row)

Apple FM is a single pre-installed model, so it can't share a "logical model" row with the open-weight runtimes above. It earns its own line as a reference point — the number to beat when "just use the system model" is the alternative.

| Runtime | Model | n | TTFT (ms) | Decode tok/s | Peak Mem (MB, in-process) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| apple-fm | Apple Foundation Model (default, ~3 B params est.) | 3 | 269 | 85.2 | 27 |

**Caveats — read before comparing.**

- **Tokens are estimated** (`utf8.count / 4`) because `FoundationModels` does not expose the tokenizer. Treat decode tok/s as ±20%; the other runtimes report counts from their actual tokenizer.
- **Peak memory is in-process only.** The model lives in Apple's system process, not ours, so 27 MB is the harness overhead — not the true model footprint. Use Activity Monitor / `powermetrics` for the system-wide picture.
- **Quant is Apple-internal.** Community reverse-engineering puts it at ~2-bit base weights + 4-bit task adapters; Apple has not published numbers. Don't read the decode tok/s as a comment on any specific quant choice.

## 🙋 Contributing a row

This table is the repo. **The easiest possible contribution is one new row.** All three of these are equally valuable:

1. **A new device.** Run the existing models on your iPhone / iPad / Mac. Tooling in [`Yardstick_USER_RUNS.md`](../Yardstick_USER_RUNS.md). The "Devices wanted" list at the bottom of [`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md#devices-wanted) is the shortlist.
2. **A new model.** Drop the model id into the [`ModelCatalog`](ios/BenchmarkApp/Sources/Models/ModelCatalog.swift) for the runtime that can load it.
3. **A new runtime.** Wire it up in [`ios/BenchmarkApp/Sources/Runtimes/`](ios/BenchmarkApp/Sources/Runtimes/) following the `LLMRuntime` protocol; the harness will pick it up.

Workflow once you have the build set up:

```sh
# 1. Run 3 times to get a stable median:
for run in 1 2 3; do
  yardstick run --task short-chat \
                --runtime mlx-swift \
                --model <id-or-hf-repo> \
                --output results/raw/<device>-<runtime>-<model>-short-chat-run${run}.jsonl
done

# 2. Regenerate the tables — they're auto-built from JSONL:
python scripts/render_results.py

# 3. Commit the JSONLs + the updated RESULTS.md, open a PR.
```

CI runs `python scripts/render_results.py --check` on every PR — it fails if the JSONLs and the tables disagree, so the human-edited section of RESULTS.md cannot drift out of sync with the raw data.

Full step-by-step (build, model picker, device-specific gotchas) lives in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What gets measured

Per `(runtime, model, device, build)` tuple:

- **Speed** — TTFT, prefill `tok/s`, decode `tok/s`, sustained-decode drift over 512+ tokens.
- **Memory** — baseline, peak during decode, after-generation.
- **Thermal** — initial / peak / final state across the run.
- **Jitter** — inter-token latency `p50` / `p95` / `p99` ms, captured from the gap between consecutive `.chunk` events. Surfaces the worst-case stall a chat UI will perceive even when the average decode rate looks smooth.
- **Energy** — joules per token. iOS uses the 1%-battery-step API; Mac uses `scripts/measure_energy.py` (wraps `powermetrics`, see "Optional: capture Mac energy" below).
- **Lifecycle** — survives background → foreground, cancellation latency, streaming.
- **Quality** *(roadmap)* — WER / CER for ASR, perplexity / MMLU for LLM, byte-identical comparison vs Python references.

Methodology lives under [`methodology/`](methodology/). The numbers we publish follow [`methodology/fairness-rules.md`](methodology/fairness-rules.md).

### Optional: capture Mac energy with `powermetrics`

```sh
sudo python scripts/measure_energy.py run \
     --task short-chat --runtime mlx-swift \
     --model mlx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit \
     --output results/raw/<device>-<runtime>-<model>-<task>-energy.jsonl
```

The wrapper starts `powermetrics` in the background, runs `yardstick`,
stops `powermetrics`, then patches the JSONL with `energyJoules`,
`averagePackagePowerW`, and `energyJoulesPerToken`. Numbers are
whole-system — run on an idle desktop and use them to compare
runtimes on the same Mac, not Macs to each other.

### Optional: import iPhone / iPad runs

The iOS app's **History → ••• → Export all (JSONL)** sheet hands you a
single newline-delimited file. AirDrop it to your Mac, then:

```sh
python scripts/import_ios_export.py ~/Downloads/yardstick-*.jsonl
python scripts/render_results.py
```

The import script splits the bundle into one
`results/raw/<device>-<runtime>-<model>-<task>-runN.jsonl` per row,
re-keying the device label so `render_results.py` recognises it.

## Running on Mac (CLI)

> **Current status (May 2026)**: SPM build is clean. Runtime is blocked by [`ml-explore/mlx-swift#349`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift/issues/349) — the MLX Metal kernel bundle isn't emitted by `swift build` from a downstream package, so `swift run yardstick run …` exits with `Failed to load the default metallib`. The same workaround applies to `mlx-swift-examples/llm-tool` (its README says "Build the llm-tool scheme in Xcode"). A macOS app target that wraps the CLI through Xcode's Metal toolchain is queued as Phase 2.

When the Phase-2 macOS target lands, this is the intended shape:

```sh
$ yardstick list
$ yardstick run --task short-chat \
                --runtime mlx-swift \
                --model mlx-community/Qwen3-0.6B-4bit \
                --output results/raw/m4max-mlx-qwen3-0.6b.jsonl
```

For now, build verification only:

```sh
$ swift build       # Build complete!
```

## Running on iPhone (app)

```sh
cd ios/BenchmarkApp
./scripts/bootstrap.sh           # downloads llama.xcframework + Anemll source
open BenchmarkApp.xcodeproj      # set your Team in Signing & Capabilities
                                 # ⌘R on a connected iPhone
```

First launch downloads the chosen model (default: `mlx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit`, ~1.3 GB) into the app's Documents directory. Use the picker to swap.

| Runtime | Adapter | Wire-up |
|---|---|---|
| MLX Swift | `MLXRuntime.swift` | SPM (`mlx-swift-lm`) |
| llama.cpp | `LlamaCppRuntime.swift` | vendored `llama.xcframework` (`bootstrap.sh`) |
| CoreML (swift-transformers) | `CoreMLRuntime.swift` | SPM (`swift-transformers` `Models` + `Generation`) |
| MediaPipe / LiteRT-LM | `MediaPipeRuntime.swift` | `canImport`-gated; add `paescebu/SwiftTasksGenAI` via Xcode UI |
| ExecuTorch | `ExecuTorchRuntime.swift` | SPM (`pytorch/executorch` `swiftpm-*` branch) |
| ANEMLL | `AnemllRuntime.swift` | local SPM via vendored `Anemll/` (`bootstrap.sh`) |
| Apple Foundation Models | `AppleFMRuntime.swift` | system framework, `#if canImport(FoundationModels)` (macOS 26 / iOS 26) |

Adapters whose framework isn't present at build time are gated with `#if canImport(...)` and fall back to a clear "not added" error rather than failing the build.

## Devices

Verified in-tree:

- [`devices/mac-m4-max.md`](devices/mac-m4-max.md) — Apple M4 Max (macOS 26)
- [`devices/macbook-air-m3.md`](devices/macbook-air-m3.md) — MacBook Air M3, 16 GB (macOS 26)
- [`devices/iphone-17-pro.md`](devices/iphone-17-pro.md) — iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26)

**Community devices wanted.** If you have an Apple Silicon device not listed above, the fastest way to contribute a row to `RESULTS.md` is to:

1. Add a `devices/<your-device>.md` describing the hardware/OS/build.
2. Run the app or CLI per [`methodology/measurement.md`](methodology/measurement.md).
3. PR the resulting `results/raw/<device>-*.jsonl` and the updated `RESULTS.md` rows.

Devices we'd love numbers for:

- iPhone 15 Pro / 16 Pro / 17 Pro Max / 17 Air
- iPad Pro M2 / M4
- MacBook Pro M1 / M2 / M3 / M4 (Pro / Max)
- Mac Studio Ultra (M2 Ultra / M3 Ultra)
- Mac mini M2 / M4

## Backend status on Mac

| Backend | Build on Mac | Run on Mac | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| MLX Swift LM | ✅ | ✅ | Native SPM macOS. The Xcode-built tool target sidesteps mlx-swift#349. |
| llama.cpp | ✅ | ✅ | `macos-arm64_x86_64` slice in `Vendored/llama.xcframework`. CLI uses `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS` to resolve the framework at runtime. |
| CoreML (CoreMLLLM) | ✅ | ✅ (some models) | macOS 15+. Models with the single-top-level `.mlpackage` layout (e.g. LFM 2.5 350M) auto-download from HF and run; the chunked / multi-`.mlpackage` repos (e.g. `mlboydaisuke/qwen3.5-0.8B-CoreML`) need upstream `CoreMLLLM` work to load. |
| ExecuTorch | ✅ | ⏸ | Build path is clean; current ET-community models ship SentencePiece `tokenizer.model` but ET's `hf_tokenizer.cpp` expects HF-format `tokenizer.json`. Needs a model with HF tokenizer or an ET-side SentencePiece adapter. |
| ANEMLL | ✅ | ⏸ | Build path is clean; `swift-huggingface.HFDownloader` fails on `.mlmodelc/` directory-shaped HF repos. Needs upstream downloader work. |
| MediaPipe / LiteRT-LM | ⛔ | ⛔ | `paescebu/SwiftTasksGenAI 0.10.24` ships only `ios-arm64` slices — no `macos-arm64*`. Blocked upstream. |

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1** — repo rename, top-level SPM (`YardstickKit` + `yardstick` CLI), Mac CLI builds clean, README + device pages, methodology docs, iOS app intact.
- **Phase 2** — Mac CLI runs end-to-end (via Xcode-built target to sidestep mlx-swift #349), first M4 Max numbers committed to `RESULTS.md`.
- **Phase 2.5** — All 5 buildable backends (MLX, llama.cpp, CoreML, ExecuTorch, ANEMLL) wired into the Mac tool target; first cross-backend row (Gemma 4 E2B: MLX vs llama.cpp).
- **Phase 3** *(in progress)* — fill remaining adapter row gaps (downloader + model-format work, mostly upstream), MacBook Air M3 + iPhone 17 Pro numbers via `[Yardstick_USER_RUNS.md](../Yardstick_USER_RUNS.md)`.
- **Phase 4** — quality / accuracy tasks: WER + CER (reusing `swift-transformers` Whisper normalizer), perplexity, MMLU subset. ASR + TTS adapters (WhisperKit, Apple Speech, system TTS).
- **Phase 5** — public results dashboard, regeneration CI, comparison plots.
